# Easy Admin

Easy Admin simply allows you to hide rarely used menu items in the dashboard, to simplify day to day work.

* Activating this plugin will create a 'Easy Admin' entry in your admin area. 
* Click it to go to the settings page. 
* Simply select the menu entry you want to hide.
* Save your settings, and you're done ! 

Of course, the Easy Admin settings page is always available, so you can always go back and show menu items you need.
